<p>Welcome! Here you will find some of the best reasons to visit the wonderful paradise of Hawaii. With some of the best beaches in the world, 
breathtaking views, and a rich culture, there is something here for everyone. Because Tyler focused mainly on design layout and was a lazy
butt, here is an old Hawiaan myth:
</p>


<p>
"Pele's influence is everywhere in Hawaii, but perhaps the strangest manifestation of her wrath is the myth that you can't take pork over 
the Pali Highway, which connects Honolulu with the windward side of Oahu. Apparently Pele and the demigod Kamapua'a (a half-man-half-pig)
 had a bad breakup and agreed never to visit each other. If you try to bring pork over the Pali, you are symbolically trying to bring
 Kamapua'a from one side of the island to the other and Pele will stop you. If you do try, according to legend, your car will stop at 
 some point on the journey and an old woman will appear with a dog. You have to feed the pork to the dog in order to continue through."
